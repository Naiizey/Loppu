You scrabble about in the debris looking for valuables, but succeed only in freeing a demon that must have previously been bound in Gastromo's cellar! It shoots up into the sky, hanging in the air above you, and taking the form of a bulky bat-winged ape with red skin and goat-like horns. "Haha! Free at last!" it howls with demonic glee, before spotting you. "Yes, you'll do! I need to harvest souls for the Dark Master!" Waving a rusty barbed trident in your direction, the Pit Demon swoops down on black wings to attack.`;
