Goff is the patron earth god of the Gnomes, and the enormous stone statue of him outside the temple depicts Goff as a muscular, serious-looking Gnome with spiky hair and beard, black robes, and a huge steel broadsword. Even as you look on, the statue suddenly comes to life, and clambers down from its plinth! As it stomps towards you on legs of rock, waving the great sword about in murderous fashion, you realize with horror that it is just about as tall as you are. \"Desecrator! Prepare to pay for your sins!\" it intones in a thunderous voice. \"Those who defile the Temple the Goff face certain death!\" You must fight the statue of the earth god in a titanic combat that shakes the very ground itself!",
